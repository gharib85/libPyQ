LibPyQ: Python Library for Quantum Information Science

In this set of functions, I'm translating LibForQ and LibForro to Python. I'm also adding 
some new functionalities that are easier to implement in Python. Further explanations and
references can be found in the comments in the original Fortran code.

Remarks:
- I don't know why, but the code involving matplotlib only works if interpreted with python3.

Disclaimer:
Anyone can use this code, respecting the licencing terms of course. But I should observe that I
make the code for my own use and for the use of my research group. So, I do not offer any warranty 
for it. Also, I usually make some tests before realesing the code, but nothing too significant. 
So I shall thank any feedback.
